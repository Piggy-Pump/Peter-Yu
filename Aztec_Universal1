Hello everybody, my name is Peter and I have brought you all some food today. Here’s one of the most common foods the Aztecs ate, the Tlacho.  Alright, you all may take a Tlacho if you wish, the word Tlacho is what the Aztecs called a filled tortilla. I did modify the original recipe a bit because I wanted to make sure it wasn’t too spicy for you all to eat. Therefore, I added one serrano pepper instead of two. This taco you all are eating is almost fat free, the Aztec’s diet did not contain any fat. The Aztecs could have came up with this recipe because they ate tortillas everyday, why not give the tortilla some filling. So they discovered the taco. This taco is made of a tortilla, turkey, tomatoes, onions, serrano peppers, poblano chilis, cilantro, slat.
